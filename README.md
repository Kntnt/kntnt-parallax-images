# Kntnt Parallax Images

WordPress plugin that adds parallax effects to images target with a CSS or jQuery selector.

## Description

The parallax effect means that the image is perceived as replaced with a cut-out rectangle, as wide but half as high as the image, through which the image can be observed as if it were in a plane some distance behind the web page.  

## How to use

By default, this effect is applied to images that either has the CSS class `parallax` or is within a container with the CSS class `parallax` and which are in singular posts. You can add the `parallax` class to an image by clicking on it in the visual editor, click on the pen in the popup toolbar, and add `parallax` in the field *Image CSS Class* which can be found under the *Advanced Options*.

By visiting the plugin's setting page, you can change on which posts types the effect should be applied, and the CSS used to target images.
